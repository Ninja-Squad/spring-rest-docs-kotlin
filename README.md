# Spring-REST-Docs-Kotlin

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Ninja-Squad/spring-rest-docs-kotlin.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Ninja-Squad/spring-rest-docs-kotlin)

For the time being, this is an experimentation of a Kotlin-based DSL for [Spring-REST-Docs](https://spring.io/projects/spring-restdocs)

There is no test yet. I hope the code works, but all I know is that the code compiles.

There is no documentation yet, either.

If you're interested, the main stuff is in the [core DSL file](core/src/main/kotlin/com.ninja_squad.springrestdocskotlin.core/dsl.kt). But to understand how the DSL looks like, you can
have a look at [the examples](examples/src/main/kotlin/com/ninja_squad/springrestdocskotlin/examples/core).
